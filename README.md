# SpaceInvaders

School Project by Samuel Bergeron and Walid Madih.

To Do:

-Implement the core elements of classic Space Invaders (1978 Release)

-Find assets (Images, Music, Sound Effects) -> doesn't have to look like original game

-Pre-load all the assets with Asset Manager class

-Space ship moves with mouse and shoots on left click

-Add collisions

-Aliens on a grid (8x4), move slowly left to right

-Aliens randomly shoot downwards

-BGM, Sound Effect on projectile shot (enemy aswell), Victory message when all enemies are shot, spaceship destroyed -> Game Over
